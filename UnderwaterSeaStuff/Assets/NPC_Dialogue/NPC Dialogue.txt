Tutorial Dialogue:

Ernie: Oh! Good morning, er…? 

Ernie: Who are you? You don’t seem familiar to these parts of the twilight zone. I should know, since this road is my assigned post…

Ef: It’s none of your concern. Do you know the fastest way to the trenches from here?

Ernie: !!!

Ernie: You appear out of nothing, then ask if I know the way to a place so highly fortified that they don’t even assign us lanterns in there… what a curious chance encounter you are!

Ernie: Do you have a name, at least, traveller? A two-way chat is quite hard without one, you know…

Ef: … Ef. And I have no time for a two-way chat. I must reach the trenches.

Ef tries to move onward. Ernie stops her by calling out to her.

Ernie: S-slow down! The pathway ahead is much darker than you could possibly imagine! It’s not safe for travellers from the daylight zone!

Ernie: Ef, was it? Hear out a little lantern, please?

Ef pulls back after a beat.

Ef: I’ve been in the darkness before. Many times… Let me show you, little one.

Tutorial to demonstrate Ef’s glowing abilities.

Ef: See? I can handle myself. Now, do you know how to-

Ernie: Y-yes, the trenches! My apologies for mistaking your abilities! However, I’m afraid I can’t tell you much at all… I can point you to the twilight zone, but not even my friends deep in the abyss know how to bypass the security there… why do you want to go to such a volatile place, anyway?

Ef: … If you don’t know, I’ll be on my way.

Ef makes to leave, this time passing Ernie. He stops her one last time.

Ernie: W-wait!! At least, before you go… are you seeking an audience with the queen?

Ef: …

Ernie: If you are seeking an end to her tyranny… you have my support, and that of all the other lanterns.

Ef: …Understood. I’ll see what I can do.

Ernie: there’s a side road not far from here that will take you into the twilight zone undetected by the queen’s people. It’s hard to find in the dark, but… well, that doesn’t seem to be a problem for you. Good luck, Ef!

Ef: … Right.

Ef leaves and gameplay resumes.


Hyde dialogue

Hyde: M-mmhh…? My tired eyes must be playing tricks on me… a traveller, in this day and age…!

Ef: Is it that much of a surprise?

Hyde: Why… yes, yes it is, young one! Long have I resided in the twilight zone… yes, even before the queen was but an ephyra, and her father before her… I recall when a squid family were considered the true royal bloodline! Hah hah hah…

Ef: (I don’t have time for the spiel of an old man…)

Ef: That’s not important right now. I’m trying to reach the midnight zone. Do you know anything?

Hyde: Th-the midnight zone…! Woe befall me, I would rather be anywhere but there! The barreleyes… their feasting… retirement is a blessing to an aging fellow such as I. See-

Ef: I’m going. Not you. Just tell me how to reach it.

Hyde: Hrmm…! My deepest regrets, young one. I lost myself in the past… I have not been for a short while now, but buffets like us fade into the background as the midnight zone consumes us… we hear things the higher-ups don’t want to be heard!

Ef: your point…?

Hyde: (he says some shit about the puzzle here)

Ef: Huh. That’s really helpful of you.

Hyde: See, look? These old zooids can still be helpful yet! Hah hah hah…

Ef: One last thing.

Hyde: Hrmm?

Ef: … I’m sorry they used you in that way. I’ll put it right, somehow.

Hyde: Such a kind soul you are, young one. When I was but a fresh siphon, I-

Ef: (…Best that I leave before he traps me here in pointless rabble forever.)


Vishi dialogue

Vishi: Surprise!!! Did it shock you to see an amphipod in the dark?

Ef: It is a little confusing. I thought your species didn’t possess bioluminescence.

Vishi: We still don’t! But when one works in the darker zones often, day or night, safety is essential! My dad invented this nice coat, and now we can work any time, any day, without fear of hazardous conditions, you see!

Ef: You work in the darker zones? That’s new.

Vishi: But of course! The queen desired new monuments, you see, so she called upon the lower people to fulfil her requests! I believe they’ll look most beautiful when complete, you’ll see!

Ef: … Could you tell me how to reach the midnight zone? Preferably avoiding the main road.

Vishi: Want to catch a sneak peek for yourself, do you? I see… Lucky for you, this amphipod is always trying to find the fastest route to work! (Puzzle shit)

Ef: Thanks. I’ll check out your monument. In return for your help, could I ask one thing of you?

Vishi: But of course! I live to serve, you see!

Ef: … Go home and rest for the day.


Ella: …

Ef: …

Ella …

Ef: …

Ella: …?

Ef: (Even in the time I was gone, coelacanths didn’t develop the ability of speech…)

Ef: (…Hm? Is she carrying something?)

Ef: (This looks like <puzzle key>… I don’t think she’ll mind if I borrow it. I’ll bring it back once this is all over, I promise…)


Miette: *Gasp* Intruder spotted! Heeheehee! Intruder spotted!!! Hiiiiii, unknown squid from the twilight zone~

Ef: You’re quite the character. Do you know the most efficient way to reach the aby-

Miette: Ah-ah! Not so fast, intruder squid! Come a little closer… Don’t worry, I won’t bite… heehee!

Ef: Your necklace of teeth says otherwise. I’ve met your kind before.

Miette: And?

Ef: You bite. A lot.

Both: …

Miette: Gah, fiiiiiine. If you already know, why are you still over there and not helping me get this over and done with quicker? Speed up the process a little?

Ef: Unfortunately, my mission requires me to keep all my tentacles intact. Is there anything I can offer you in place of one?

Miette: You have food?

Ef: … Sadly not.

Miette: Then what do you… mmm… actually, you could help me with one thing. Just a small favour, and no eating! No chewing, no munching! You’re free to go!

Ef: And that would be…?

Miette: My adorable little siblings have been playing by the border, and ma wanted me to come pick them up… but they’ve up and run off! If you find them for me, I’ll leave you alone… heehee.

Ef: They’re not too far from here, right?

Miette: They’re still young’uns, they haven’t even got legs yet! You’ll find them, no effort.

Ef: … Fine. If it’s as easy as you say.

Miette: Yay! Yippee! I knew I could trust you!
